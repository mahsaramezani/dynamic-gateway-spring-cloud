# Dynamic Gateway Architecture with Spring Cloud Gateway

## Motivation
APIs are inherently dynamic, yet most API gateways rely on static route configurations.

### The Problem
In a microservices ecosystem, routes evolve frequently. Traditional solutions such as **Zuul**, **Kong**, or **Traefik** often require manual YAML edits or even full service restarts to apply route changes.

### The Solution
This project implements a **custom Spring Cloud Gateway** backed by a **database** to manage routes dynamically. This approach eliminates downtime and simplifies route management.

### Why Not Existing Tools?
- Existing gateways often introduce unnecessary complexity.
- They can be opinionated, making them difficult to customize.
- Route-level testing and versioning are not straightforward.

## Key Features
- Store route definitions in a **database**
- Manage routes dynamically through a **CRUD API**
- Integrate with **Spring Data JPA** and future **cache abstraction** for performance improvements
- Provide validation and monitoring using **Spring Boot Actuator** (planned) and **custom route test endpoints**
